# Visualising Binding Free Energies Using Swap-based Methods

## Aimed at: 
Anyone interested in learning how to run WaterSwap, LigandSwap or ProteinSwap 
calculations for predicting and visualising how changes in a ligand or mutations 
of a protein affect protein-ligand binding.

## Requirements: 
Knowledge of Python, e.g. as gained from the 
Python for Biomolecular Modellers workshops. The material from the Python 
workshops will be online and is self-study, in case you are not able to 
attend the workshop on Monday.

## Abstract: 
The swap-based methods (WaterSwap, LigandSwap and ProteinSwap) are explicit 
solvent tools that enable you to calculate absolute and relative 
protein-ligand binding free energies. They can be used to predict how 
ligand binding is affected by protein mutations, or to predict selectivity 
of a ligand to different members of a protein family. In addition, these methods 
provide an in-built residue-based decomposition of the binding free energy, 
enabling you to visualise and rationalise predicted changes in binding 
affinity according to changes in specific protein-ligand interactions. 
This workshop will introduce the swap-based methods, and will take you 
through the process of running and analysing WaterSwap, LigandSwap 
and ProteinSwap simulations.

## Training Material

The workshop consists of a series of Jupyter notebooks. These are available
below, and can be run using the 
<a href="https://ccpbiosim.github.io/workshop/events/bristol2018/server.html" target="_blank">workshop jupyter server</a>.

Once you have started the server, navigate to the `xswaps` directory and you will find the
notebooks there.

## Contents

The workshop is divided into three parts. You should complete
[LigandSwap](ligandswap/README.md) first, 
but are free to then look at 
[WaterSwap](waterswap/README.md) or 
[ProteinSwap](proteinswap/README.md) in any order.

* [WaterSwap](waterswap/README.md)
* [ProteinSwap](proteinswap/README.md)
