    "# Using ProteinSwap to Investigate Mutation\n",
    "\n",
    "ProteinSwap is very similar to LigandSwap. The simulation swaps a single ligand between two different proteins. This gives a free energy that indicates which protein binds the ligand most strongly. This is useful to investigate the effect of mutation. For example, you could swap a ligand between the wildtype and mutant protein. If the proteinswap free energy is negative, this indicates that the mutant binds the ligand more strongly. If the proteinswap free energy is positive, then this indicates that the mutant binds the ligand more weakly, and is therefore potentially resistant to that ligand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like ligandswap, proteinswap is distributed as part of Sire. The program is found in the `$SIRE/bin` directory, assuming that `$SIRE` has been set to the directory in which Sire is installed. This notebook relies on the proteinswap that comes with version 2018.1 or later of Sire.\n",
    "\n",
    "You use proteinswap in a similar way to ligandswap. Like ligandswap, proteinswap comes with detailed help via `--help` and `--help-config`."
