    "From the view we can infer that the mutation has weakened binding to between the ligand and the residues to the left (including the R292K). This is unsurprising, as lysine is a smaller residue than arginine, and so it is not able to reach to oseltamivir and bind as well. Conversely, oseltamivir compensates by binding more strongly to the residue on the right (ARG38). The increased binding to ARG38 is not enough to compensate for the loss to ARG212 and SER166, and so the mutant binds oseltamivir more weakly, and is thus drug-resistant. This suggests that, to overcome resistance, the oseltamivir needs to be made slightly larger so that it can reach the smaller LYS212, while still having a stronger interaction with ARG38."
