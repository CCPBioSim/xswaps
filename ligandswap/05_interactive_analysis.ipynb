    "So, there are lots of possible free energies that can come out of a single ligandswap calculation. How do you know which one is \"right\"? In general, I look for agreement between all of the methods. Bennetts method converges the quickest, and is generally the most reliable, while FEP is the slowest and least reliable. I look for when Bennetts, FEP and TI all agree to within 1.0 to 1.5 kcal mol-1. If they don't agree, then I run more iterations to encourage convergence, or if this takes too long, will instead use the Bennetts result. If the simulation doesn't converge, then I will plot the convergence of the different methods versus iteration, and will look for iterations where the free energy jumps away from the average. I will then look at the structures sampled at those iterations to see if a rare event has taken place (e.g. conformational change of a residue or displacement of a water molecule). If it has, then this either means that more sampling is needed, or that ligandswap is not capable of making a good prediction for this system.\n",

The error should be the spread between the different methods, e.g."
