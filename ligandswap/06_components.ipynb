    "One of the major advantages of ligandswap over other relative binding free energy methods is that it supports decomposition of the free energy averages into per-residue components. How it does this is [described in detail here](https://siremol.org/tutorials/ligandswap/theory.html).\n",

If the relative binding free energy is negative (ligand at lambda=1 binds better than the ligand at lambda=0) then this will be because this ligand has stronger interactions with the residues, and so you should see lots of negative residue free energy components. Similarly, if you get a positive free energy, then you should see lots of large positive components. \n",
