    "There are many ways to align molecules. ligandswap uses a “maximum common substructure” alignment. The program looks at the connectivity (bonding) of the atoms to find the largest common substructure (framework / scaffold) of the two ligands.

    "![](images/aligned.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the figure above shows a snapshot from VMD of aligned_ligands.pdb. In this, you can see that swapping FM1 with CTI will just involve losing the flouromethyl group and replacing it with a hydrogen. This swap does not involve a large change in the shape or volume occupied by the ligands in the protein binding site, so there is a good chance that the ligandswap free energy calculation will converge well and give a more robust prediction of relative binding free energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the alignment isn't correct, then you can add an optional match string to the ligandswap command to tell it which atoms are equivalent in the two ligands. The format of the match string is a comma-separated set of pairs of atom names, e.g. `A1:B1,A2:B2,A3:B3`. This says that the atom called `A1` is the first ligand is equivalent to the atom called `B1` in the second ligand, that `A2` is equivalent to `B2`, and `A3` is equivalent to `B3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we wanted to force ligandswap to match the atoms called `C1`, `C2` and `C3` in FMC to `C1`, `C2` and `C5` in CTI, then the match string would be `-m C1:C1,C2:C2,C3:C5`, and the full ligandswap command would be\n",
