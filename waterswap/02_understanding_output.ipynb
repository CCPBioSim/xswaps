    "# Understanding the output of WaterSwap\n",

    "waterswap is fully automatic. This means that you donâ€™t need to do anything to get the calculation to run. However, waterswap will print a lot of output to let you know what it is doing, and to give you a chance to check that everything is ok.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output from waterswap is very similar to ligandswap. The only differences relate to the fact that the ligand is being swapped with water. If you are happy with ligandswap then waterswap should make sense.\n",

    "Because waterswap calculations take a long time, we have provided some example output for you from this simulation. This is in example_output.tar.bz2 and can be unpacked using the cell below."

If too few are selected then there will be parts of the ligand that will not be replaced by water.
