    "# Understanding the output of WaterSwap\n",
    "\n",
    "waterswap is fully automatic. This means that you donâ€™t need to do anything to get the calculation to run. However, waterswap will print a lot of output to let you know what it is doing, and to give you a chance to check that everything is ok.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output from waterswap is very similar to ligandswap. The only differences relate to the fact that the ligand is being swapped with water. If you are happy with ligandswap then waterswap should make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the cell below to see example output from a waterswap simulationThe output from waterswap is very similar to that of ligandswap. "

These are copied into the protein complex in place of the ligand and equilibrated for a number of steps. The equilibrated water molecules are written to a file called `swapcluster01.pdb`. When you run waterswap in production you should take a look at this file and make sure that the choice of water molecules fits neatly under the ligand. For example, the picture below shows the ligand and swapped water molecules.\n",
