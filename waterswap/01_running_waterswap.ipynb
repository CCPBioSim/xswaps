    "# Running WaterSwap\n",

    "WaterSwap has almost exactly the same interface as, and is run and analysed in the same way as LigandSwap. The only difference is that in WaterSwap, you swap a ligand with a cluster of water molecules. This means that you only have to supply a single topology/coordinate file set for the protein-ligand complex you are studying. The calculation is then very similar to LigandSwap, except now, as you are swapping the ligand for water, the calculation will return the absolute binding free energy.\n",
