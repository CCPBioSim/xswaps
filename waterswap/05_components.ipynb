    "\n",
    "Like ligandswap, one of the major advantages of waterswap over other absolute binding free energy methods is that it supports decomposition of the free energy averages into per-residue components. How it does this is [described in detail here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3fd00125c).\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this mean? Well, it means that waterswap can give you an indication of which residues contribute most to the binding of the ligand to the protein. More subtlely, it reveals which residues the calculation showed as binding more strongly to the ligand, and which bound more strongly to the water.\n",
    "\n",

    "This splits the total free energy into the contribution from the protein box (\"BOUND\") and the contribution from the water box (\"FREE\"). In this case it shows that most of the free energy (-62 kcal mol-1) comes from a preference of the protein for the ligand over water. This is larger than the 28 kcal mol-1 preference of bulk water for the ligand over the swapped water. This implies that the ligand is very soluble, but it binds much more strongly to the protein than to bulk water. This is unsurprising, as the ligand is zwitterionic (has two charges), and so is both highly soluble and well-suited to the highly charged binding site of the protein.\n",
